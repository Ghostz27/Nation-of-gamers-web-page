				<p>Welcome to IGN's Grand Theft Auto: Vice City game guide. From Mission Walkthroughs, Hidden Packages locations, Stunt Jumps, and Secrets, our GTA Vice City guide will cover everything you need to complete the game.</p>

				<p>The Eighties brought us many things: hot pink, legwarmers, cheesy synth pop, big hair and crime. Drug crime. Lots and lots of drug crime. Of course, we don't mind. All the coke lords and shootouts and vendettas make for a lot of quality entertainment. Without 80's crime we wouldn't have had Miami Vice, Scarface, Tango & Cash , and now... Grand Theft Auto: Vice City.	</p>

				<p>Set firmly in the Reagan Era, Vice City is a continuation of everything you learned from the first game. If you think that by now you're a smooth criminal, think again. Vice City packs a lot of new stuff into the experience: new missions, new weapons, new music, new cars, tons of secret jumps and hidden packages, and, of course, lots and lots of cops to avoid.</p>

				<p>The game has added some cool features as well. Now you can buy up pieces of the city, ride motorcycles and scooters, aim, ghost ride cars, go inside buildings, and much more. It's an even fuller experience than the last game even was... and that's saying a lot.</p>

				<p>Here's the story. You, Tommy Vercetti, have been sent south from Liberty City to Vice City, Florida to do some business; some drug business, with some unsavory cats who just might have it in for you. But the deal goes sour and you have to figure out what went wrong and survive the streets of Vice City. Who knows? Maybe there will be some opportunities for expansion...</p>

				<p>Our GTA Vice City guide help you in all aspects of your conquest. We've got a detailed walkthrough with multiple solutions to each mission, a full secrets section, Cheats, Unique Stunt Jump tips, Rampage info, locations of all 100 Hidden Packages and more. Now grab a bat and let's get to work...</p>
