<div class="para">
	<p>BY COLIN STEVENS This year’s Dota 2 Battle Pass includes an experimental “Avoid Player” list that aims to ensure you won’t match with players you don’t want to.

Revealed on Dota 2’s International Battle Pass 2019 page (via GamesIndustry.biz), the page states "Not all players and playstyles work well together. To help keep your team chemistry balanced and fun, we've added an experimental Avoid Player list that guarantees you won't match with a player again.

	 <b><i>Dota 2 REVIEW</i></b>
	 <p>BY PHILL CAMERON - There’s an adage that the Dota 2 community often quotes when someone identifies themselves as a new player. “Welcome to Dota 2!” They say, with open arms, before concluding with, “You suck.” They're not wrong: for the first dozen hours or so, you'll be bombarded with too much information and an often unforgiving community of extremely competitive players. But if you persevere, Dota 2 becomes one of the most rewarding and tense team-based multiplayer experiences anywhere in gaming. It's an achievement owed to uncompromising depth, a ridiculously generous free-to-play model, and the great features developer Valve has built up around it.
