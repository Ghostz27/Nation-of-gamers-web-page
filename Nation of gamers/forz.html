	<p>Forza Horizon, more than the excellent-but-far-more-serious Forza Motorsport, has always elicited pure joy. Each Forza Horizon entry is like a 72-degree summer day, complete with a gentle breeze, in video game form. Forza Horizon 4 again took the series to new heights, and it's even trying to one-up the stellar Horizon 3 in the expansion pack department. The third Horizon brought us one of the greatest uses of a license ever in the form of its Hot Wheels add-on, and now Forza Horizon 4 looks to up the ante by giving us LEGO Speed Champions.

	 <b><i>Forza Horizon 4 Review</i></b>
	 <p>orza Horizon 4 retains almost everything that made Forza Horizon 3 the best racer in its class and bakes it into a game that doesn’t ever want you to stop playing. The stunning visual quality and sound design, the massive array of automobiles, and the extensive and completely customisable career mode that have become hallmarks of the Horizon series are all here. What’s new is just how much more effectively Forza Horizon 4 encourages us to return thanks to its shifting seasons, regularly refreshed challenges, and steady stream of rewards.
Every real-time week the in-game season will change and bring a whole new look to the world, alongside a bunch of season-specific challenges. Every day there are still more new Forzathon challenges to complete, and every hour there is a live, online event to participate in alongside up to 11 other drivers who we work with cooperatively in order to chip away at a shared goal.</p><br>
