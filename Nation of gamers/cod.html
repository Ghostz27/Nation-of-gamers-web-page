		<b><i>THE TOP-SELLING THIRD-PARTY CONSOLE GAMES OF ALL TIME</i></b>
</div>	

<div class="para">
	<p>BY JONATHON DORNBUSH If you guessed GTA V and any of several Call of Duty's would dominate the lists of top-selling third-party games of all time, you'd be right. But how do they all stack up to one another, across all platforms through over 20 years?

Well, Mat Piscatella of the NPD Group compiled the top 10 best-selling third-party published games on all Nintendo platforms combined since NPD began tracking this data back in 1995. Piscatella also provided IGN with data for the top 10 third-party games (through May 2019) on PlayStation and Xbox consoles, as well as across all platforms. Ranking of the best-selling games for each platform is based on total dollar sales.

And, as noted by NPD, physical tracking of game purchases began in 1995, while digital sales began to be tracked back in 2012. Not all publishers report all numbers, however.
