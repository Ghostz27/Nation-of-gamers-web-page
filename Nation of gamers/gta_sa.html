			<td><p>The Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas Wiki Strategy Guide features a full Walkthrough for every Story Mission and Side Activity, locations for every Unique Jump, Tags, and Oysters, as well as Cheat Codes and Secrets, and much more. Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas is currently available on PS2, Xbox, Xbox 360, PS3, PC, OS X, and iOS and was first released on October 26, 2004.</p>

<p>	So, GTA: Vice City wasn't enough for you, huh? You wanted a bigger challenge, didn't you? Or maybe you wanted to play an almost unlimited version of Grand Theft Auto? Well, Rockstar has answered your prayers. With breadth and scope surpassing anything on the PS2, San Andreas is not only great... it's enormous! What exactly are you in for? Read on...</p>

<p>	This massive game spans the entire state of San Andreas, with visits to three major cities patterned on real-life counterparts. There's Los Santos (based on Los Angeles), a gritty blur of smog and violence; San Fierro (based on San Francisco), and Las Venturas (based on Las Vegas), a midnight wonderland crawling with money, sex, and corruption.</p>

<p>	Three cities would have been more than enough to keep gamers busy for months, but Rockstar went and did it... adding huge chunks of countryside that link all the areas together. Contained within this massive landscape is a helluva lot of game.</p>

<p>	There are dozens of missions, hundreds of cheats and secrets, tons of vehicles and weapons, and all kinds of new stuff to do. Stuff like recruiting gang members, swimming, getting tattoos, graffiti tagging, building property, riding bikes, eating, working out, getting a haircut, attracting the ladies and much, much more. And we've got the guide to it all right here</p></td>
