			<h3>GOG GALAXY 2.0. ALL YOUR GAMES AND FRIENDS IN ONE PLACE.</h3>
				<iframe width="946" height="532" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nyYW9AOWh-8" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

							There are two things that matter to all of us gamers: the games we play and the friends we play them with. But as more titles come with dedicated launchers and clients, our games and gaming buddies become scattered in between them. With GOG GALAXY 2.0, you’ll be able to combine multiple libraries into one and connect with your friends across all gaming platforms!
				“As gamers, we need to juggle between multiple clients to access our games and see what our friends are playing,” says Piotr Karwowski, Managing Director at GOG. “We believe gamers deserve a better experience, and this became the driving force to redefine GOG GALAXY client,” Karwowski adds. “GOG GALAXY 2.0 is designed for all gamers and extends well beyond existing GOG.COM users, into both PC and console platforms.”
				Once you connect GOG GALAXY 2.0 with other platforms, it will import all your games into one library. You will see your friends activities and online status across connected platforms. All new library and friends features apply to your GOG.COM games and enhance your experience. And it’s designed to protect your privacy – your data belongs to you and will never be shared with third parties. We see it as an all-in-one solution for the present-day gamer.
				Experience GOG GALAXY 2.0 yourself — sign up for the closed beta at www.gogalaxy.com and be among the first to get access to it!

				<h2>SADDLE UP FOR A SHOWDOWN THROWDOWN</h2>

				<img src="D:\WeB assignment\R6 showdown.JPG" width="600" height="350">
			<br>
			<br>
			<br>



							FROM JULY 2ND TO 16TH
				They roam across the land, bringing order to those who ain’t got any, and they ain’t about to let nobody stop them. They are The Law. 
				On the opposite side, the lawbreaking Graveltop Gang. Some say that gunpowder runs through their veins. The only thing they believe in is gold, and they will grab it by hook or by crook. 

				In the Wildest days of the West, these two factions clashed on many occasions, yet the Graveltop Gang always managed to vanish into the desert. Until they finally faced off in the husk of an old fort. That day, they say, bullets rained like never before. 

				These two have grudges to settle… and bodies to bury.

				<br>

				<br>
								
								FOR A FISTFUL OF GOLD
				Meet The Law, or the big guns as we like to call ’em. 
				There’s never been a band of gunslingers more dedicated to justice:
				</center>
		<ul>
			<li>	Erik “Maverick” Thorn,		</li>
			<li>	Eliza “Ash” Cohen,		</li>
			<li>	Emmanuelle “Twitch” Pichon,	</li>
			<li>	Vicente “Capitão” Souza,	</li>
			<li>	Timur “Glaz” Glazkov	</li>
			
			<br>		
					They’re on a hunt to arrest their sworn enemies, the ghastly Graveltop Gang. 
					These bandits let their guns do the talking, and they don’t speak surrender:
			<br>		

			<li>		Aria “Alibi” de Luca,		</li>
			<li>		Jalal “Kaid” El Fassi,		</li>
			<li>		Taina “Caveira” Pereira,		</li>
			<li>		Adriano “Maestro” Martello,		</li>
			<li>		Julien “Rook” Nizan		</li>

		</ul>
		<br>
		<center>
						<h3>	A SHOWDOWN Collection </h3>
		<br>	
			<p>As you relive the tale, you can get your fill of western duds with the Showdown Collection’s customization items. There are 31 exclusive items for you to obtain, the very same your Event Operators will be wearing and more. There won’t be no duplicates in your pack, sheriff’s honor. Each Showdown Pack costs 300 R6 credits.
